Principals of Programing Languages

#Introduction#

- point
  - sub point
	- sub point
	
#Definitions#
- Strongly Typed
  - a programming language will prevent the successful execution of an operation on arguments that have differing types

- Weakly Typed
  - programming language will implicitly convert, or cast, types when different types are present in an operation


#Definitions#

-Dynamically Typed
  	- def
-Staticly  Typed
  	- def

#Duck Typing #

"If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck..." A duck-typed language is dynamic and does its type checking at runtime.

_Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission:_

    try:
      x = my_dict["key"]
    except KeyError:
      # handle missing key
_Look Before You Leap:_

    if "key" in my_dict:
      x = my_dict["key"]
    else:
      # handle missing key


#Core Principles#

######Lua design decisions: 
- Keep the language simple and small.
- Keep the implementation simple, small, fast, portable, and free.

######Excerpts from the Zen of Python (PEP 20):
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.
